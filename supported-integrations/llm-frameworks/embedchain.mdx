Embedchain simplifies personalized LLM application development by efficiently processing unstructured data. It segments data, creates relevant embeddings, and stores them in a vector database for quick retrieval.

## Setup

1. Install Langtrace's SDK and [initialize](/quickstart) the SDK in your code.
2. Install EmbedChains's SDK and [initialize](https://docs.embedchain.ai/get-started/quickstart) the SDK in your code.
3. Use the `langtrace` SDK to capture traces from your EmbedChain app.
