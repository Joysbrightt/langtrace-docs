DSPy is a framework for algorithmically optimizing LM prompts and weights, especially when LMs are used one or more times within a pipeline.

Langtrace has first class support for DSPy, allowing you to capture traces from your DSPy pipelines or agents automatically and analyze them in Langtrace.

## Setup

1. Follow the [DSPy installation guide](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy?tab=readme-ov-file#1-installation) to install DSPy.
2. Install Langtrace's SDK and [initialize](/quickstart) the SDK in your code.
3. Run your DSPy pipeline or agent and view the traces in Langtrace.

## Troubleshooting

### Missing LLM Calls in Traces

If you're not seeing LLM calls in your Langtrace traces when using DSPy, consider the following:

<Accordion title="DSPy Caching">
  DSPy implements caching of LLM calls by default. This means that repeated identical calls to the language model will not trigger new API requests, and consequently, won't generate new traces in Langtrace.

To ensure you're seeing all LLM calls:

1. **Disable caching**: If you need to trace every call for debugging purposes, you can disable DSPy's caching mechanism. Refer to the [DSPy documentation](https://dspy-docs.vercel.app/docs/faqs#deployment-or-reproducibility-concerns) for instructions on how to disable caching.

2. **Vary your inputs**: If you're testing, make sure to use different inputs for each run to avoid hitting the cache.

3. **Clear the cache**: If you need to re-run the same inputs, consider clearing DSPy's cache between runs.

4. **Check your DSPy configuration**: Ensure that your DSPy setup is correctly configured to use the LLM provider you expect.

If you continue to experience issues after considering these points, please contact our support team for further assistance.

Remember to always use caching judiciously in production environments to balance between comprehensive tracing and optimal performance.

### Grouping of Spans in Trace when using ThreadpoolExecutor in DSPy

If you're using ThreadpoolExecutor in DSPy to parallelize your modules, you may notice that the spans in the trace are not grouped together. This is because the spans are created in the same thread and are not propagated to the parent span. To resolve this issue, 

<Accordion title="Span Grouping for ThreadpoolExecutor">
  Please use the provided code snippet as an example to ensure that the current tracing context is properly propagated when executing tasks within a `ThreadPoolExecutor`. The contextvars module is used to copy the current context and run the optimized CoT module within the copied context. By passing `contextvars.copy_context().run` to the `executor.submit` method, the current tracing context is propagated to the child span ensuring that the spans are grouped together in the trace.

  ```python
import dspy
import contextvars
from dspy.datasets.gsm8k import GSM8K, gsm8k_metric
from dspy.teleprompt import BootstrapFewShot
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

# flake8: noqa
from langtrace_python_sdk import langtrace, with_langtrace_root_span

langtrace.init(api_key="<your-langtrace-api-key>")

turbo = dspy.OpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", max_tokens=250)
dspy.settings.configure(lm=turbo)

# Load math questions from the GSM8K dataset
gsm8k = GSM8K()
gsm8k_trainset, gsm8k_devset = gsm8k.train[:10], gsm8k.dev[:10]

class CoT(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.prog = dspy.ChainOfThought("question -> answer")

    def forward(self, question):
        return self.prog(question=question)

@with_langtrace_root_span(name="parallel_example")
def example():
    # Set up the optimizer: we want to "bootstrap" (i.e., self-generate) 4-shot examples of our CoT program.
    config = dict(max_bootstrapped_demos=4, max_labeled_demos=4)

    # Optimize! Use the `gsm8k_metric` here. In general, the metric is going to tell the optimizer how well it's doing.
    teleprompter = BootstrapFewShot(metric=gsm8k_metric, **config)
    optimized_cot = teleprompter.compile(CoT(), trainset=gsm8k_trainset)

    questions = [
        "What is the sine of 0?",
        "What is the tangent of 100?",
    ]

    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=2) as executor:
        futures = [executor.submit(contextvars.copy_context().run, optimized_cot, question=q) for q in questions]

        for future in futures:
            ans = future.result()
            print(ans)
