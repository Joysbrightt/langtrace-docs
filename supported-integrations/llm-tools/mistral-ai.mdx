## Setup

1. Install Langtrace's SDK and [initialize](/quickstart) the SDK in your code.

*Note: You'll need API keys from Langtrace and MistralAI. Sign up for [Langtrace](https://langtrace.ai) and/or [MistralAI](https://mistral.ai/) if you haven't done so already.*

```bash Python
# Install the SDK
pip install -U langtrace-python-sdk mistralai
```


2. Setup environment variables:
```bash Shell
export LANGTRACE_API_KEY=YOUR_LANGTRACE_API_KEY
export MISTRAL_API_KEY=YOUR_MISTRAL_API_KEY
```


## Usage

Generate a simple output with your deployment's model:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import os
from langtrace_python_sdk import langtrace, with_langtrace_root_span
from mistralai import Mistral

langtrace.init(api_key=os.environ["LANGTRACE_API_KEY"])


@with_langtrace_root_span("chat_complete")
def chat_complete():
    model = "mistral-large-latest"
    client = Mistral(api_key=os.environ["MISTRAL_API_KEY"])
    chat_response = client.chat.complete(
        model=model,
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "I need 10 cocktail recipes with tequila other than the classics like margarita, tequila"
            },
        ]
    )
    print(chat_response.choices[0].message.content)


chat_complete()

```
</CodeGroup>

You can now view your traces on the Langtrace dashboard:
