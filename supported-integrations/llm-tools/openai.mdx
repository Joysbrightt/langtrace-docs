Using Langtrace to monitor your OpenAI LLM is quick and easy. Follow these steps:

## Setup

1. Install Langtrace's SDK and [initialize](/quickstart) the SDK in your code.

Note: You will also sign up and get an API key from OPENAI [initialize] (https://openai.com/) if you haven't done so already.

2. Install packages and setup environment:

```bash Python
# Install the SDK
pip install -U langtrace-python-sdk openai
```
## Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use Langtrace with Openai:

```python Python
# Imports import os

import os

os.environ['LANGTRACE_API_KEY'] = "YOUR_LANGTRACE_API_KEY"
os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = "YOUR_OPEN_AI_API_KEY"
```

Imports

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
 from langtrace_python_sdk import langtrace # Must precede any llm module imports
langtrace.init(api_key = os.environ['LANGTRACE_API_KEY'])
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(
    # This is the default and can be omitted
    api_key=os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
)
```

    </CodeGroup>

4. Generate a simple output with OPEN AI'S GPT 3.5 MODEL:

<CodeGroup>
     ```bash Python
chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What is LangChain?",
        }
    ],
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
)
print(chat_completion.choices[0].message.content)
 ```

</CodeGroup>

5.  Lets also create some embeddings:
<CodeGroup>
    ````bash Python
    response = client.embeddings.create(
    input="Your text string goes here",
    model="text-embedding-3-small"
)

print(response.data[0].embedding)
    ````
</CodeGroup>
You can now view your traces on the Langtrace dashboard
